  <h3>Production Engineering Research Project on a Sheet Forming Process - Manipal University (2016)</h3>
  <p>
    At the end of my engineering degree, I carried out a major research project on a process modern and complex process called Incremental Sheet Forming. It is widely used to accurately form sheet metals in aircrafts, vehicles and on any machinery that requires high level of build accuracy.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>The project aimed to model equations that predict friction for a sheet metal process.</li>
    <li>Implementing original prototyping and analysis techniques, conducting lab experiments and leveraged observed data.</li>
    <li>With the help of processing of data on MATLAB, I derived a set of equations that calculated the forces with a worst deviation being just 27%.</li>
    <li>In most cases, the deviations were stable and less than 5% from experimental values. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>This achievement was unprecedented as the deviations using older methods were upto 65% inaccurate in certain cases.</p>

  <h3>Gloabl Market research and analysis of Online Commercial Real Estate - Fizzy Homes (2019)</h3>

  <ul>
    <li>Analyzed commercial real estate trends in 9 megacities globally and reported insights and revised the business case.</li>
    <li>Quantitative analysis report on insights, scope and possible expansion strategies.</li>
    <li>Researched reliable information available on public domains and cited them for statistical and textual representation.</li>
    <li>Identified areas of risk and suggested improved approaches in sales strategy.</li>
    <li>Developed intensive researching skills, understanding of real estate metrics and applied tools learnt while training for MSc.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Data analysis reports of net promotor scores - Zomato (2018)</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Comprehensive data collection and analysis of B2B net promoter scores.</li>
    <li>Visualized data to support critical strategic facts and documented potential causes.</li>
    <li>Developed skills in data analysis on user empathy maps and visualization in Tableau.</li>
  </ul>
